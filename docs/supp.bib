              correlations, Journal of Multivariate Analysis 97 (2006)
              2177--2189] based on partial correlations. The latter is based on
              the so-called D -vine. We extend the methodology to any regular
              vine and study the relationship between the multiple correlation
              and partial correlations on a regular vine. We explain the onion
              method in terms of elliptical distributions and extend it to
              allow generating random correlation matrices from the same joint
              distribution as the vine method. The methods are compared in
              terms of time necessary to generate 5000 random correlation
              matrices of given dimensions.",
